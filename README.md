# Books Sinatra App

This is a books app created through ruby Sinatra.

First install the following gems:
- gem "sinatra"

- gem "rack"
- gem "pg"

This app can be accessed by going into Git bash and enter rackup, this will then provide you with a port number by a HTTP request. You then go into google and type in localhost/'portnumber' to get to the index page of the books app.

Once on the index page, there is a header with books and a new books option. The new books is where you can add a new book into the system and onto the database. If you click on the title of the book it will lead you to the show page, where the is information about the book as well as an option to edit the book. The edit button will take you to the edit page where you can edit the details of the book and it will be updated onto the database.
